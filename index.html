        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>To provide undergraduate students with the educational experience of an interdisciplinary design and engineering challenge by collaboratively designing and building an electric-only racecar for competition in a series of events. Formula Hybrid gives students hands-on experience with the challenges of creating and implementing a wide variety of technologies while being part of an interdisciplinary team. Students get a unique opportunity to turn classroom concepts into tangible skills and to interact with some of the most talented professionals in the emerging technology industries.</p>
        <h1>Primary Objectives</h1>
        <p>Arrive at competition with a fully compliant, operating electric vehicle. The design of the vehicle will be tailored to excel in the endurance race and to stay within the allocated budget. Utilize existing FSAE Chassis and working components with it.</p>
