        <h2>Integrations Team</h2>
        <p>The Integration Team is responsible for any low-voltage circuitry and wiring (VCU, Dashboard Control Module, etc.), as well as some of the high-voltage wiring and circuitry such as the charging system and safety shutdown circuit. As the name suggests, they integrate all the systems of the car together electronically through connecting sensors to computer modules that communicate with one another over a CAN Bus serial communication network.</p>
        <h2>Powertrains Team</h2>
        <p>The powertrains team works on what moves the Formula-Hybrid vehicle forward. This includes the high-voltage electric motor, internal-combustion engine, and the axles leading to the wheels. The specialties presented by a hybrid racecar means we work with specialty parts, including a custom frame and mounts to properly integrate the necessary parts together.</p>
        <h2>Manufacting Team</h2>
        <p>The manufacturing team is responsible for the process of taking one's ideas, designs, or drawings and manufacturing high-quality parts with the equipment on hand or determining if outsourcing is necessary. Members of the manufacturing team assist in all areas of the engineering process, from assisting in the design work to machining the components needed for the complete project. We work closely with other teams to ensure everyone's manufacturing needs are met.</p>
        <h2>Suspensions Team</h2>
        <p>The Suspension Team is in charge of designing, testing, and tuning the suspension system, as well as implementing the hydraulic brakes and the steering system. The suspension team works closely with the powertrain team and the chassis team to ensure that the weight of the vehicle is controlled in an efficient way throughout the entirety of the race. </p>
        <h2>Battery Teams</h2>
        <p>The Battery Team is responsible for the design, test and engineering of
            the accumulator used to power the car while keeping the lightest
            weight possible.The team strictly follows the DFM (Design for
            Manufacturing) and safety rules. We provide hands-on experience in a
            multi-phased project development process and in engineering design
            practice.</p>
        <h2>Aero Team</h2>
        <p>The Aero team is responsible for the design, manufacturing, and implementation of all aerodynamic components on the vehicle. It will be a challenge, but we will run simulations on several different designs to determine the optimal body for the car.</p>
        <h2>Chasis Team</h2>
        <p>The Chassis Team is responsible for the structure of the car.  We are designing the frame of the car and running tests to ensure that our design will be strong enough to hold everything together and keep the driver safe.  This means working closely with the other teams, such as Suspension, Powertrain, Battery, Aero, and Manufacturing, to build a top performing racecar.</p>
