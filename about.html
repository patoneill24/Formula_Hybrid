        <h1>Meet the Teams</h1>
        <h2>Integrations Team</h2>
        <p>The Integration Team is responsible for any low-voltage circuitry and wiring (VCU, Dashboard Control Module, etc.), as well as some of the high-voltage wiring and circuitry such as the charging system and safety shutdown circuit. As the name suggests, they integrate all the systems of the car together electronically through connecting sensors to computer modules that communicate with one another over a CAN Bus serial communication network.</p>
        <h2>Powertrains Team</h2>
        <p>The powertrains team works on what moves the Formula-Hybrid vehicle forward. This includes the high-voltage electric motor, internal-combustion engine, and the axles leading to the wheels. The specialties presented by a hybrid racecar means we work with specialty parts, including a custom frame and mounts to properly integrate the necessary parts together.</p>
        <h2>Manufacting Team</h2>
        <p>The manufacturing team is responsible for the process of taking one's ideas, designs, or drawings and manufacturing high-quality parts with the equipment on hand or determining if outsourcing is necessary. Members of the manufacturing team assist in all areas of the engineering process, from assisting in the design work to machining the components needed for the complete project. We work closely with other teams to ensure everyone's manufacturing needs are met.</p>
